# Configs

Configurations and Files used during installation.


These files shouldn't be edited for a ROMHack.
Instead, edit the files found within the instance install directory. (ie `Installs/RHRBRS_0.1/`)

### TODO List

* Install `Pallettes` so changes aren't in `git` tree
* Install `TileSets` so changes aren't in `git` tree
